  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented via DialogContent data-state animation classes, but REQ-1 is only gated by loginStatus (disabled state) and not explicitly by authentication/identity presence. Tailwind config changes include broad theming additions not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Attention pulse on Login button must run only when the user is unauthenticated (identity not present), and must not run after authentication.",
      "reason": "LoginButton enables the pulse whenever loginStatus is not \"logging-in\" (i.e., whenever the button is not disabled). There is no explicit check for identity/authenticated state in this component, so the pulse is not guaranteed to be limited to unauthenticated users based on the shown changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/LoginButton.tsx (shouldPulse = !disabled; className uses shouldPulse only)"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Large Tailwind theme extensions (fonts, colors, fontWeight, container, etc.) beyond defining the specific keyframes/animations needed for the requested attention pulse and modal transitions.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for adding a login-button pulse and modal enter/exit animations, with constraints to implement via className/Tailwind/app CSS. The diff shows broad design-system/theme modifications in tailwind.config.js that are not required to satisfy those animation requirements.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/tailwind.config.js (extend: fontFamily, fontWeight, colors, container, etc.; truncated but clearly present)"
