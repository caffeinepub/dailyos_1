  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented via mobile-only single-letter tab labels in DailyDashboard. Mobile navigation controls were added in Header, but they are icon-only and may not satisfy the requirement that controls be clearly labeled on phone-sized screens. The diff is truncated for MainDashboard’s FinanceTrends implementation, so full verification of Compare removal / Net Balance-only rendering cannot be conclusively confirmed from the provided snippet, though the file summary claims it.",
