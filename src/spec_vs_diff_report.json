  "summary": "Diff adds a mobile viewport hook and a custom Recharts Pie label renderer that positions percentage text inside slices, and updates DailyOverviewSection to use mobile-specific pie sizing/margins. FinanceTrends in MainDashboard is modified with an isMobile flag, but the diff is truncated so full-width behavior and desktop non-impact can’t be fully verified from provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Fix mobile-only pie chart label overflow for all pie charts that render percentage labels (not just Daily Overview), keeping percentages visible and preventing any pie SVG/legend/tooltip overflow, without affecting desktop/tablet layout.",
      "reason": "The diff shows updates for DailyOverviewSection pie charts and adds a reusable label renderer, but there is no visible evidence that other pie charts across the app (e.g., in other sections) were updated to use the new renderer/mobile sizing constraints. Also, no evidence is shown regarding legend/tooltip overflow handling beyond DailyOverview’s margin/radius changes.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "On mobile, Finance Trends line chart expands to full available card width and improves x-axis label spacing/readability, with no desktop/tablet layout changes and no data/logic/tooltip-format changes.",
      "reason": "MainDashboard.tsx shows FinanceTrends now uses useIsMobile, but the relevant chart/container layout changes are not visible in the truncated diff; therefore it’s not possible to confirm that the line chart uses full available width on mobile and that desktop/tablet remains unchanged.",
