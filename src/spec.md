## Summary
**Goal:** Improve mobile usability by adding phone-friendly navigation between Dashboard and Daily View, and simplify the Dashboard Finance Trends card to always show only the existing Net Balance chart.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “Compare” option from the Main Dashboard Finance Trends card UI and always render only the Net Balance line chart (preserving existing data inputs, calculations, formatting, and styling for both 7-day and 30-day ranges).
- Add mobile-only navigation controls on phone-sized screens to switch between Dashboard and Daily View without affecting desktop/tablet navigation.
- On phone-sized screens only, abbreviate Daily View tab labels to single letters: Overview (O), Activities (A), Finance (F), Habits (H), Journal (J), while keeping tablet/desktop labels unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** On phones, users can always switch between Dashboard and Daily View via clear navigation controls, Daily View tabs are compact (O/A/F/H/J), and the Dashboard Finance Trends card no longer offers Compare and consistently shows the Net Balance chart only.
